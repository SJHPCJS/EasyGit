# README

+ Please remember to use command to add execution permissions to this script, like:

    ```shell
    chmod +x easygit.sh
    ```

+ You can remove the format suffix '.sh' and add the script to your PATH, such as '/usr/local/bin' (This may require temporary administrator privileges via **sudo**). Thus you can use the options in this EasyGit script more conveniently, like:

    ```shell
    easygit some_option some_parameter
    ```

    It's OK not to do so, but that means a little harder in using the EasyGit command:

    ```shell
    ./easygit.sh some_option some_parameter
    ```

    And when the current position is inside the repository:

    ```shell
    ../easygit.sh some_option some_parameter
    ```

    So we strongly recommend you do according to the instruction above as this may save you a little time.

+ The **easygit help** command lists all the options provided as well as their parameter requirements and usages.

+ To manage your repository, please first enter the repository folder using the **cd** command.
